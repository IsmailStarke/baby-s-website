                                This isn't the biggest website ever. But I hope it's enough to put a smile on that beautiful
                                face of yours.<br />
                                Can you believe that it has been so long my Babytjie. Do you remember all the good times we have been 
                                through? All the hard times we have been through? It has been a long road. A tough road. We have struggled, 
                                and we have fought. We have fought against each other, we have fought for each other, and here we still are.
                                Smittenly in love.<br />
                                I remember using the word "smittenly" for the first time in front of you. You smiled at me and told me, "I 
                                like that word...smittenly". You have always been the cutest. My Cutest. My Baby.   
                                So I know you're anxiously waiting..."Why Does Ismail Love Me? Why Me?"<br /><br />
                                <b>So let me tell you why...</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I love the way you look at me. So softly, with that cute massive smile on your face.
                                I love that smile. I love those glimmering, shining big eyes. I love your kind heart.
                                I love that you care for everyone and everything, not just me. Whether it be the 
                                smallest ant, or the biggest elephant ever, me, Ash, Vee, you care for everyone. No 
                                matter what. You're sympathetic, you're empathetic, you're loving, the list is endless.
                                I love when you say "All I want to do is hold you and take care of you." You have no idea 
                                just how amazing you are. I love your cooking. I love how you bring me lunch sometimes. Like 
                                when you bring muesli and you make sure that there's a section for me where there is only 
                                muesli and nothing else because I love muesli so much.

                                I love how you make sure that when we bring the desk to the bed, you set the pillows nicely behind 
                                so that when I am done eating I can relax nicely. I like how you know that my feet get cold so you 
                                get your pink blanket to make sure I am warm enough. I love big cuddles. I love picking you up 
                                and I love how you hold me when I do. I love how much you want to have a baby. I love that you love 
                                my curly hair. I love that you want our children to have curly hair. I love that you make me 
                                confident. I love how eager you are to have a wedding. I love your beautiful mind. I love how you
                                think. I love your openness. I love that you want the best for me, and I love that you would do 
                                everything in your power to make me:
